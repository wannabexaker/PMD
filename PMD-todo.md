Dashboard â€“ Structural & UX refinement (professional pass)

Context
The dashboard currently mixes project lists, counters, and pie charts, but there are UX and logic issues:
- Missing â€œUnassignedâ€ visibility
- Pie charts are cramped and labels are truncated
- Font size and layout reduce readability
- Status logic is duplicated across cards, counters, and charts

Goals
Clean, professional dashboard with clear hierarchy, single-source-of-truth logic, and readable analytics.

Required changes

1) Add â€œUnassignedâ€ project column
- Add a new column at the far left named **Unassigned**
- It contains projects with zero assigned people
- Column order must be:
  Unassigned â†’ Assigned â†’ In Progress â†’ Completed
- Counts shown on the column headers must match backend stats exactly
- Project cards in Unassigned must behave exactly like others (menu, hover, etc.)

2) Status logic unification
- Define project status categories once (shared logic):
  Unassigned, Assigned, In Progress, Completed, Canceled, Archived
- Use this same logic for:
  - Left project columns
  - Top counters
  - Pie charts
- No duplicate or parallel counting logic in frontend components

3) Pie charts layout & readability
- Change pie charts layout to **vertical stacking** (one below the other)
- Ensure:
  - No label truncation (no â€œâ€¦â€)
  - Legends are fully readable
  - Slightly smaller font size (labels + legend text)
- Charts must resize gracefully and never overflow their cards

4) Visual hierarchy cleanup
- Reduce visual competition between:
  - Project columns (left)
  - Stats cards (right)
- Charts are secondary analytics, not primary navigation
- Keep spacing consistent and breathable

5) Professional UX details
- Keep color mapping consistent across:
  - Status badges
  - Pie slices
  - Legends
- Ensure numbers in counters, columns, and pies always match
- No hardcoded values; everything must come from stats API

Expected result
A clean, enterprise-grade dashboard:
- Immediate visibility of unassigned work
- Clear project distribution by status and team
- Readable charts without truncation
- One coherent data model powering all statistics

MongoDB Data Model Refactor â€“ PMD (Professional Structure)

Goal
Redesign the MongoDB database schema from scratch so it is:
- Clean
- Explicit
- Easy to reason about
- Scalable for future features (stats, audits, analytics, permissions)
- Suitable for a professional, production-grade system

We allow DROP + RESEED of the database.

General Rules
- Use clear, explicit collection names (plural, lowercase)
- Avoid overloaded documents
- Prefer references over deeply nested documents
- Every entity must have:
  - _id
  - createdAt
  - updatedAt
- Use enums consistently (status, role, team)
- Prepare schema for statistics & historical tracking
